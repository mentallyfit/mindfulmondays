# Mindful Mondays

Our goal is to create a community for people to share and harness the benefits of meditation and mindfulness. We imagine Minful Mondays as a secular space for people who are curious about meditation to try meditation and encounter a variety of approaches, styles and traditions without having to make commitments to any particular group or practice.

## Values

We aspire to conduct ourselves and communicate with Humility, Curiousity, Open-mindedness and Compassion.
